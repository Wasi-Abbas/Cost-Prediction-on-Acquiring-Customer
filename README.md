# Project Title: Cost Prediction on Acquiring Customers

## Introduction
In today's competitive business landscape, understanding the cost associated with acquiring customers is crucial for making informed marketing and financial decisions. This project focuses on developing and evaluating various regression algorithms for predicting the cost of acquiring customers using historical data. The following regression algorithms were applied to the dataset:
1.	Linear Regression
2.	Ridge Regression
3.	Lasso Regression
4.	Support Vector Regression (SVR)
5.	Decision Tree Regression
6.	Random Forest Regression
7.	Gradient Boosting Regression
8.	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
9.	Polynomial Regression
The primary goal of this project is to identify the most accurate and robust model for predicting customer acquisition costs. Additionally, we aim to provide insights into the factors that contribute to these costs.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical information on customer acquisition campaigns, including features such as member card, promotion name, channel used and customer demographics. The target variable is the cost incurred for each campaign.

## Methodology
## Data Preprocessing
Before applying regression algorithms, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables where necessary.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Each regression algorithm was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to assess predictive performance.

## Findings
Model Performance
The following are the performance results for each regression algorithm:
1.	Linear Regression: MSE: [890.1486], R²: [0.0155]
2.	Ridge Regression: MSE: [890.1486], R²: [0.01550]
3.	Lasso Regression: MSE: [894.9165], R²: [0.01023]
4.	SVR: MSE: [906.8834], R²: [0.00300]
5.	Decision Tree Regression: MSE: [2.1150], R²: [0.9976]
6.	Random Forest Regression: MSE: [1.1614], R²: [0.9989]
7.	Gradient Boosting Regression: MSE: [652.3022], R²: [0.2785]
8.	KNN Regression: MSE: [663.3891], R²: [0.2662]
9.	Polynomial Regression: MSE: [852.2405], R²: [0.05743]
   
## Model Comparison
Based on the evaluation metrics, the Random Forest Regressor outperformed the other regression models with the lowest MSE and the highest R² value. This indicates that Random Forest Regressor is the most accurate and reliable model for predicting customer acquisition costs in this context.

## Future Contributions
This project provides a foundation for understanding and predicting customer acquisition costs. To further enhance the project's contributions, future work could focus on the following areas:
#### Feature Engineering: Investigate additional features that may influence customer acquisition costs and incorporate them into the modeling process.
#### Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble techniques to combine the strengths of multiple regression models and potentially improve predictive accuracy.
#### Dynamic Modeling: Develop time-series models to account for seasonality and trends in customer acquisition costs, allowing for more accurate predictions.
#### Cost Optimization: Extend the project to include optimization techniques that help businesses minimize customer acquisition costs while maximizing customer value.
#### Real-time Prediction: Implement the model into a real-time system for on-the-fly cost predictions, enabling businesses to make informed decisions during marketing campaigns.
By addressing these areas, this project can provide even greater value in assisting businesses with cost-effective customer acquisition strategies.
